# FirstDraft

FirstDraft is a writing tool designed to help you **resist the temptation to edit** while working on your first draft.

**Allowing edits only to the word you are currently typing** encourages you to focus on writing rather than making premature corrections.

This tool is the perfect companion for writers who enjoy the convenience of digital tools but want to **embrace their creative flow**, saving edits for later.
